### 1. Travelling Salesman Problem
Solving the traveling salesman problem using three different algorithms.

### 2. Perceptron
Solving the classification problem using a single neuron learned by a gradient-free method

### 3. Multi-criteria classification using single-layer neural network.
The exercise consisted in writing an application that will teach a single-layer network with a given weight matrix for a given number of epochs on a learning sequence given in the form of a matrix of examples (inputs and requested outputs). The network is built of neurons with a sigmoidal activation function. The result of the function is a prediction of the animal's cluster based on 5 pieces of information.

### 4. "Feed-Forward" Artificial Neural Networks as universal approximators.
The exercise consisted in generating two functions:
1. providing a cyclic waveform with little variation in amplitude and period.
2. providing a sufficiently irregular waveform.

Using the neurolab.net.newff function, an application was written simulating the learning of feed-forward networks. Then for different learning methods and the number of neurons in the hidden layer, it was necessary to determine the total learning error of the network and to show on the graph its fit to the actual course.

### 5. Genetic Algorithm
The exercise consisted of writing a program finding the maximum of a function using the genetic algorithm method. Then, study the effect of one-point crossover probability and mutation probability on the rate of convergence of optimization results.
