### 1. Travelling Salesman Problem
#### Solving the traveling salesman problem using three different algorithms.

### 2. Perceptron
#### Solving the classification problem with using a single neuron learned by a gradient-free method

### 3. Multi-criteria classification using single-layer neural network.
#### The exercise consisted in writing an application that will teach a single-layer network with a given weight matrix for a given number of epochs on a learning sequence given in the form of a matrix of examples (inputs and requested outputs). The network is built of neurons with a sigmoidal activation function. The result of the function is a prediction of the animal's cluster based on 5 pieces of information.
